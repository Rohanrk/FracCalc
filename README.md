/* FracCalc is a project that takes any 2 fractions and can perform 
* addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with them. The code uses Scanners
* with delimiters to parse each fraction and eventually convert the answer to fractional form
* Mixed numerals are written in the form Whole_num/den. (Ex: 1.5 would be written as 1_1/2)
* Currently the code does not take an infinite amount of input. If more than 2 terms are input
* into the system, the program will only parse the first 2 fractions involved.
